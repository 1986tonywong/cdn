## About service stop {#section_lj2_j4v_tdb .section}

1.  If a bill for a CDN service becomes overdue, that service may be interrupted.
2.  Your service is suspended if your service fee is overdue by 24 hours. You will receive an SMS or email reminder to pay the overdue bill within 24 hours. If the overdue payment is received within 24 hours, your service is not affected.
3.  If payment for the bill is not completed within 24 hours, your CDN service will be suspended. The cache resources you are using will then be released, but your configuration information will be retained for 12 months.

## Balance warning promptÂ  {#section_xs3_q4v_tdb .section}

1.  PayByTraffic: The system determines whether your account balance is sufficient to pay for your CDN service for the next three billing cycles based on the average amount payable under your CDN service bill for the last seven hours. If not, the system will send you an alert by SMS or email.
2.  PayByBandwidth: The system determines whether your account balance is sufficient to pay for your CDN service for the next billing cycle \(day\) based on the amount payable under your CDN service bill for the last billing cycle \(day\). If not, the system will send you an alert by SMS or email.
3.  If you have enabled the balance warning feature \(Console \> Billing Management \> Balance Warning ON/OFF\), you will receive an alert by SMS or email when your account balance falls below the warning threshold you have set.
